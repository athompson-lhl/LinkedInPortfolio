1_ NetworkAdministration
In this project, you will create a report that includes details and information about the devices in your Lab environment. You will use Nmap and Wireshark to discover details about each device, confirm your discovered information by double-checking it on the devices themselves, and then create network documentation to support your discoveries. To support your findings, you will also document how and where you found the information you include in your documentation.

2_ ReportOnRisksAndVulnerabilities
In this project, you will create a report that gives recommendations on sensors that should be monitored, associating the sensor with well known IoCs for the organization in the case study. The report explains what sensors should be used, prioritizing them and connecting them to IoCs, threats and vulnerabilities. It specifies what alert thresholds need to be set and why.

3_ LogMonitoringWorkflow
In this project, you will demonstrate how to apply the programming tools and commands that you have learned about to a professional Cyber Security scenario. You will establish a workflow to monitor for unusual traffic, including the key commands or scripts you will use, expected output, and next steps.

4_ PlaybookForCatAndBoxScenario
In this project, you will create a custom playbook using the NIST Incident Response Lifecycle as well as the guidelines shared by CISA for developing playbooks meant for incident response. The playbook will address a potential Cyber Security breach in the scenario described in the project.

5_ RiskManagementCaseAStudy
In this project, you will use the ISO 27001 Risk Management Framework to create a Risk Management Plan for the scenario described in the case study. You will utilize your understanding of Risk Assessment Table, Risk Treatment Table, and Statement of Applicability (SOA) to complete the Risk Management Plan.

6_ CatsCompanyVulnerabilities
In this project, you will analyze the results of a vulnerability assessment scan, and write a vulnerability assessment report for the executive team. The report will include detailed scan results, methodology, findings, risk assessment and prioritized recommendations.

7_ IRPlanPlaybookAndPolicy
In this project, you will create an outline for a policy set. Within each policy outline, you will indicate what playbook(s) would be used and why. You will utilize the NIST 7-step incident process for this project and submit a slideshow that explains “Why” each policy is recommended and the consequences of non-compliance for both the company and the individual.

8_ Encryption
In this project, you will create a report that explains how basic security approaches and practices can be used to protect company employess and information from a potential Cyber Security breach. You not only have to review the entire Cyber Security policy for the company, but also start the conversation to utilize basic concepts to protect the users.
To present to the company's board, write a report and be prepared to explain it to the board and to all the tech teams working with you.
The report must be written using an executive format such that it can be understood by readers with technical as well as non-technical background.

9_ WritingInvestigationAndResearchReport
In this project, you will develop an investigation and research report on a Cyber Security attack of your choice and record different aspects of the attack such as tools and technologies used in the attack, systems targeted, security controls and mitigation techniques employed post-attack, etc.

10_ ForensicsReportAndDocumentation
This project uses a scenario created by DFIR Madness. You will work through Case 001, The Stolen Szechuan Sauce. You will work with another classmate to answer the list of questions around the case by investigating the artifacts provided.

11_ Secure ArchitectureReportAndRecommendations
This project work is an extension of the Full-scale Mapping activity that you completed earlier. In the Full-scale Mapping activity, you completed the end-to-end security architecture assessment of the mid-sized, e-commerce company. In this project, you will now write a report that suggests mitigation strategies for the vulnerabilities and the weaknesses you identified in the Full-scale Mapping activity.
